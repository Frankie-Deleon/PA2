     * employees. Sales revenue is captured by month within a quarter; therefore, the user can enter as
     * many quarters as needed as long as the quarters are not less than 1 or greater than 4. If sales
     * revenue is on target by 50% or more for a sales rep, an encouraging message is sent; otherwise,
     * a warning is sent. If sales revenue to date for the company is greater than or equal to 100% of
     * projected annual sales, then employees qualify for a 2-5% year-end bonus; otherwise,
     * no yearend bonus can be expected.
